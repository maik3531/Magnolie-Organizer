# Full original-contact return: open implementation scope (#622)

This is a source-boundary assessment, not an implemented capability or a source
grant. The completed DAV lifecycle work in #621/#623/#624 does not complete this
scope. No installed-app, physical device or live-provider acceptance is claimed.

## Notes: two different existing paths

- `magnolie-notes/.../telefon/ContactValueWrite.kt` resource **19** accepts only
  `telefone` and `emailEintraege`. Preparation and apply receipts carry the exact
  selected field set and account tuple. `ContactValueWriteAndroid.kt` binds a
  short-lived ticket to its authenticated channel, original lookup/raw contact,
  provider version and native account. It is not a full-content resource.
- `magnolie-notes/.../baum/KontaktSync.kt` and `KONTAKT-PROTOKOLL.md` already carry
  the full v2 names/raw N/FN, scalar and postal model over authenticated transport.
  `Baumwerk.kontaktUebernehmen` currently stages that content in `kontaktEingang`.
  It does **not** automatically update the original Android contact.
- `Baumwerk.kontaktUebernahmeBestaetigen` performs explicit reviewed adoption.
  Its planning can select merge, replacement or creation. Its prior protection
  and `AndroidKontakte.uebernehmen` raw-version assertions are reusable building
  blocks, not authorization to call that whole manual flow automatically.
- `KontaktSpur` binds partner/share ID to lookup/raw ID and content hashes, but
  does not itself seal native account/source identity or grant automatic writes.
  `Partner.kontaktSync`, trust, authenticated capabilities and native Android
  READ/WRITE_CONTACTS permission are also not independently a per-source approval.

The full return must therefore have a distinct explicit admission. Do not widen
resource19's field set, relabel a share/cache update as delivery, infer permission
from tree settings, or allow the manual flow's create/replace choices to leak into
update-only automation. Whether reusing the full tree envelope or introducing a
separately negotiated phone resource, both receiving native source authority and
the desktop result-save correlation must be connected and tested before enabling
or advertising it. No new resource/version is allocated by this assessment.

## Existing provider boundaries

| Counterpart | What the source establishes | What is still needed for this automatic path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Notes Android | Authenticated full DTO; explicit reviewed full writer; targeted resource19 writer with native revision assertions | Native once-configured per-source consent, exact original/account binding, update-only full writer/readback and correlated durable result receipt |
| Stock KDE Connect / Android | Existing upstream read path | A genuinely supported counterpart write capability; do not invent a KDE write packet or use Notes capabilities for another peer |
| Akonadi | The actual helper re-fetches the requested collection/item, checks `CanChangeItem`, collection ownership and exact revision/UID, disables automatic conflict handling, and reads the modified item back. Python requests bind collection generation/instance and native item ID/revision | Connect these native identities/rights to distinct durable approval and protected automatic result-save admission; helper existence/discovery labels alone do not grant it |
| EDS | Existing `BookClient` connection and explicit ordinary modify/readback functions | Independently establish backend-specific guarded update semantics, current writable rights, exact source/revision and durable consent before adding automatic authority |

In particular, the current ordinary EDS `eds_kontakt_aendern` uses `_buch_flags()`
(`NONE` when available) and has a legacy signature fallback. It is **not** a proven
compare-and-swap adapter for this stricter automatic path. Upstream documents that
the default conflict mode keeps the local value, and that operation flags may be
ignored by unsupported backends. Merely passing `CONFLICT_FAIL`, observing an
address-book revision or checking a contact before writing cannot by itself prove
atomic backend CAS. This is an unfulfilled automatic-path requirement, not a
claim that every ordinary EDS synchronization has reproduced a data-loss bug.

Relevant upstream contract:

- [BookClient.modify_contact_sync](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/evolution-data-server/libebook/method.BookClient.modify_contact_sync.html)
- [BookOperationFlags](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/evolution-data-server/libebook-contacts/flags.BookOperationFlags.html)

No new blanket minimum dependency version, old-API downgrade, permission fallback
or installation follows from these differences. An unsupported source stays held
or read-only, without blocking separately supported approved sources.

## Required transaction and acceptance

1. A genuine native setup decision binds the confirmed peer and each exact native
   account/source identity to durable revocable authority. Imported settings,
   content mappings, capabilities and provider labels cannot mint it.
2. A committed/unrepaired native Organizer SaveACK identifies the exact current
   local book and pending full-field edit. A transient connection/credential wait
   preserves human intent without granting currently unavailable access.
3. Re-read the exact existing original and current native rights/revision. Refuse
   ambiguous aggregate/raw targets, changed account/source identity, missing
   baseline and unrepresentable fields. Never fall back to a default book, name
   matching, canonical UID substitution, create or delete.
4. Protect the actual original before the guarded provider operation. Preserve
   unrelated native rows and metadata, and assert revision at the actual mutation
   boundary, not just during preparation. Isolate contact/source conflicts.
5. Verify original identity and all written names/scalars/postal values by native
   readback. A transport ACK or cached DTO is not a save receipt. Hold uncertain
   outcomes for reconciliation instead of replaying an apply automatically.
6. Advance the local source baseline only through the existing actual encrypted
   writer and its exact confirmed result SaveACK. Preserve newer edits, all other
   book domains, Notes priority and clean-result no-loop behavior.
7. Exercise native sender/receiver and frontend/writer wiring separately for Linux,
   Windows and Notes, then label any later physical acceptance separately. Existing
   device/VM/install/publication pauses and conditional delivery remain effective.

## Current targeted evidence

`magnolie-organizer/pruefungen/test_phone_contact_values.py` adds 36 negative/positive
boundary cases: nine full-return-only fields are rejected at preparation, apply
and report validation, and at the actual native value RPC before transport. A
rejected widened apply leaves a genuine phone/email ticket usable. The affected
56-case matrix passes. This protects resource19's existing scope; it does **not**
implement the full return above. Notes effective inputs have not changed and no
Notes rebuild or installation is warranted by these tests/documentation alone.
